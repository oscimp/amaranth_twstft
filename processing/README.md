# Acquisition and processing software

**The content of this directory is obsolete and superseded with ../acquisition.
For archive only (and maybe future conversion of Octave processing to C++
if speed is needed).**

## C

``stat.c`` is a short program for the Raspberry Pi to display the
last file access and update: used to store the last sample date
and hence recover the timestamp of each correlation peak

## Octave

GNU/Octave (Matlab-compatible) processing scripts ``godual_ranging*``
for analyzing the binary file generated by ``b210_file.py`` and produce
a .mat file with the timestamps, frequency offsets, SNR and received
power. The ``_remote`` extension is the same script than without the 
extension, only dupplicated to allow execution of both scripts in parallel
when an acquisition was completed. 

Once all ``.bin`` files have been processed
and all ``.mat`` files generated, the relevant information is exctracted
and stored as a text file by ``gofinal*``.

Finally, the content of the text files are analyzed for ranging or two-way
time transfer analysis by ``ranging.m`` and ``tw.m``

## Python

``b210_file.py`` is the GNU Radio Companion generated acquisition script
for the Ettus Research B210 SDR, manually updated.

## Shell:

Various scripts for the Raspberry Pi4 including the /etc/init.d/S60jmf
for configuring the single board computer when booting, the crontab script
scheduling the data acquisition and go.sh for toggling the switch between
SATRE and SDR emitter as well as storing data in the appropriate locations.
